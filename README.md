# *RD-JavaScript*
A JavaScript Library that simplifies with the HTML5 Canvas mainly.

# *About*
Started this project to help other people make visuals using JavaScript and the canvas. Currently it only works with the 2D context so no fancy 3D graphics.

# *How to get started*
I've provided an index.html file which you can open in your web browser of choice (use Google Chrome for best compatibility). You will also put any JavaScript you write in there. Alternatively you can use the line marked below the script line for the RD.js to link your own seperate JavaScript file.
